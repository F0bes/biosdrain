# biosdrain

## **Instructions**

Download the latest version of biosdrain under the GitHub releases page.

### - **For PS2LINK / PS2CLIENT users**

Execute biosdrain on the EE. For example: `ps2client execee host:biosdrain.elf`

biosdrain should automatically detect a host filesystem, and dump the files directly to your computer.

### - **For USB users (using uLaunchELF)**
Put the biosdrain.elf file onto a FAT32 formatted USB drive.

In uLaunchELF, navigate to `mass:` and execute the biosdrain.elf file you just transferred.

biosdrain should automatically detect a USB drive, and dump the files to the root of the USB drive.

### **Using the BIOS with PCSX2**
Simply download the files (if you've used a USB drive) back to your computer, and keep them somewhere safe so you don't have to do this process again.

## **I politely ask that you do not share your BIOS files!**

If the path to your bios was `D:\ps2bios\dump` you'd see one of the below.

\* These are dumped at a fixed size of 512kb and at fixed addresses

### Notes

This software has been based off of the work from [PS2Ident](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/PS2Ident) licensed under AFL license-3.0 . The Sysman and Romdrv module source have been taken from there as well.

Proper erom driver loading is not available on PCSX2. Thereby making erom dectection return a false negative. (Not that it really matters).

Issues and pull requests are very much welcome. The issue tracker may be used by users to report successful dumping as well, as I only have a single 39K to test on. Please make sure your model doesn't already have a report though.
